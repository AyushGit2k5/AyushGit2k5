# Hi, I'm Ayush 👋

I am an undergraduate Artificial Intelligence student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and applied AI. I focus on building end-to-end ML systems, comparing models, and evaluating performance using appropriate metrics.

## Projects
- **CNN Image Classification (Fashion-MNIST)**  
  Built and compared a baseline MLP and a CNN to classify clothing images, achieving improved accuracy and F1-score through spatial feature learning.
